## Activity 1: Implementing OSI Model

The OSI model can actually not be implemented because its not a communication protocol.
The faculties basically want you to simulate what data flow would look like if a protocol followed the OSI Model.

###OSI Model :

The OSI model presents a standard data flow architecture, with protocols specified in such a way that the receiving layer at the destination computer receives exactly the same object as sent by the matching layer at the source computer. 

The OSI Model has 7 Layers:

7.  Application
6.  Presentation
5.  Session
4.  Transport
3.  Network
2.  Data link
1.  Physical
