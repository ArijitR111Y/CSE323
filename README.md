### Course Syllabus

#### Cycle Sheet 1

1. Write a C program for OSI Layer
2. Write a program to implement the following Encoding Techniques 
  [ NRZ, NRZ-I ,Manchester, 4B/5B ]
3. Write a program for framing Techniques:
  1. Character Count
  2. Bit Stuffing and Destuffing
  3. Byte Stuffing.and Destuffing
4. Write a program for Flow control based on Sliding Window protocol (outcome –l)
  1. Go Back N ARQ
  2. Selective repeat ARQ
5. Write a program to implement CRC polynomials

#### Cycle Sheet 2

1. Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set
the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
2. Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2,
n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant
Applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the
number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.
3. Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6
nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
4. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N-nodes(6-10), change error rate and data rate and
compare the throughput.
5. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot
congestion window for different source/destination
